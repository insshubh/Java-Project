# Producer-Consumer Problem Implementation

This project implements the classic Producer-Consumer problem using Java, showcasing multithreading and synchronization techniques. Built as part of my Java Development learning journey, it leverages industry-standard practices and advanced concepts.

## Overview

The solution features two threads:
- **Producer**: Generates data and adds it to a shared buffer
- **Consumer**: Removes and processes data from the buffer

A `BlockingQueue` ensures thread-safe communication, preventing overflow or underflow.

## Features

✔ **Multithreading**: Utilizes Java threads for concurrent execution  
✔ **Synchronization**: Implements `BlockingQueue` for safe producer-consumer interaction  
✔ **Logging**: Integrates SLF4J with Logback for detailed event tracking  
✔ **Configurable Delays**: Adjustable timing for producing and consuming data  
✔ **Advanced Topics**: Covers design patterns (Observer), memory management, and potential RESTful integration  

## Prerequisites

- **Java**: JDK 11 or 17
- **Maven**: For dependency management
- **Eclipse IDE**: Recommended for development
- **Dependencies**: SLF4J and Logback (managed via `pom.xml`)

## Installation
